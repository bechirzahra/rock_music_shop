/*
    We want to open a rock music shop in the beautiful
    old town of Tuebingen. For this we need a small system
    to catalogue the available record collection in our store.

    Each music album features the following criteria:
    - id number
    - band name
    - album title
    - year of release

    When we open our music shop the first day,
    the following titles are available:

    - 1, "Nickelback", "Dark Horse", 2008
    - 5, "Metallica", "Reload", 2003
    - 11, "Red Hot Chili Peppers", "Californication", 1999
    - 8, "Cake", "Fashion Nugget", 1996
    - 85, "Linkin Park", "Minutes To Midnight", 2007

    We want to present two lists of available albums,
    one sorted by "band name" in ascending order and one
    sorted by "year of release" with the latest one first.

    Now we just need a way to manage, sort and output the lists
    in an object oriented way... Bechir, can you help us?

    A console application displaying the sorted lists would be fine.

    Please apply the following design patterns:
    - data enscapsulation
    - iterators
